# Clone of Tembusu's Personal Assistant: Misty

This is a Chatbot for Tembusu College residents' use. It is built upon Dialogflow and is integrated with Telegram (only for this version).

The code might seem a bit messy because this is a version before the refactoring. Google Assistant, Skype, and Slack integration are not included in this version. Note that some of the "####" strings inside the code represents sensitive information. Everyone is free to use any parts of the code at this point. This project uses many libraries such as moment, firebase, etc. Please exercise you own discretion when using them.

Unfortunately, newer versions of the app will not be published again in GitHub.
