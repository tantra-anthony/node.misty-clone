# Clone of Tembusu's Personal Assistant: Misty

This is a Chatbot for Tembusu College residents' use. It is built upon ApiAI/Dialogflow and is integrated with Telegram (only for this version).

Google Assistant, Skype, and Slack integration will NOT be included in GitHub. Note that some of the sensitive information is deleted from the project folder. Everyone is free to use any parts of the code at this point. This project uses many libraries such as moment, firebase, etc. Please exercise you own discretion when using them.

You are free to commit any changes as long as they're reasonable. You can suggest some new features by visiting https://tinyurl.com/mistyform.
